# SELF-BALANCING ROBOT 

This repository has five branches:

- `main`: This contains main script for robot,
- `PID_block_component`: This contains script for PID implementation.
- `display_controller_feature`: This contains script for displaying UI on OLED.
- `mpu_reader_feature`: This contains script for reading acceleration and gyroscope values.
- `cleaning_code`: Change code style to OOP and cleaning all script.

## Overview
This project presents the design, implementation, and control of a self-balancing two-wheeled robot. Unlike traditional self-balancing robots, this project incorporates a user interface (UI) for initialization, parameter observation, and tuning of the PID controller, including Kp, Ki, and Kd gains, as well as a setpoint. These parameters are stored in the ESP32â€™s non-volatile memory to ensure data persistence even after power cycles. Self-balancing robots have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in various fields, such as transportation, robotics, and education.
